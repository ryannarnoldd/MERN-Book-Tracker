## Installation

To install this project, the user must clone the repository from GitHub (The link where you are reading this). Then, you need to change the `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and add your own information. After that, you need to run `npm install` in the terminal to install all the dependencies. Running `npm run build` is just as important after. Once that is all done, you can run `npm run develop` to start the server. (Front and back) The user will then be able to test the API using GQL.

## Usage

Once `npm run develop` is run, the user will be able to navigate to the browser and use the application. The user will be able to create an account (using the login and signup form). Under the search books tab, the user is able to search any book (that is known under the Google Books API) and view up to 10 books at a time. The user is able to save the books to their account, and view them under the saved books tab. The user is also able to delete the books from their account (given as an option under each saved book).
